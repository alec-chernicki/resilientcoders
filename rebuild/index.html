            In partnership with
            <a href="http://www.freshtilledsoil.com/" target="_blank">Fresh Tilled Soil</a>
            we will (re)build a website for a non-profit organization for free.
            Three finalists will be selected by our panel of judges, and then we’ll hand it over to the general public to vote for the winner.
        </p>

        <h5>
            We're proud to offer a single round of design work and a static website that reflects that design.
            Extra features may not be supported, per our discretion. The website created may be referenced by
            Resilient Lab as a case study and sample of our work. Ongoing support after the site is finished
            is not included. Hosting solutions not provided, though we're happy to advise you on your hosting.
            Finalists will be asked for all of the final copy and imagery to be used in the new website,
            during the public voting period. Any organization that hasn’t gotten this material to us
            before voting ends will not be considered, even if they get the most votes.
            We’ll ask the winning organization to send us a point of contact to join us for a kickoff meeting.
        </h5>
