    description: "The first project Resilient Lab ever tackled was UX and visual design for Wanderu's iPhone app, in December of 2014. Bringing the \"Kayak\" concept to ground travel, on a mobile device, presented us with some meaty UX challenges, on which we worked collaboratively with Wanderu's amazing team.",

    description: "HelpScout has a great company tradition based on the Swedish \"Fika,\" social coffee break. We were glad to have a chance to contribute. Using Javascript, PHP, and MySQL, we created an application that randomly pairs employees over a particular prompt, on the push of a button. New employees can just as easily be added to the pool."
