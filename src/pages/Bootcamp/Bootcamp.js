              The idea behind our Bootcamp is an audacious one: Take a small cohort of young
              people, who face more challenges than most, who have been hand-picked by our
              partners for their grit, and teach them fundamentals of web development so that
              they may have access to a real career.

              Our next Bootcamp will begin in January 2016. If youâ€™re interested in joining,
              come to one of the upcoming Maverick Landing Hackathons. They will be at 31 Liverpool St.
              in East Boston. The first one is on Saturday November 5th, and the second is Friday
              December 12th, both from 10 to 4. Registration is done through our partners at Maverick Landing Community Services.

              from 3:30 to 6. We're all about making it easy for you to join.
