    bio: `I'm immensely proud to be a Howard-bred hustler with
    an insatiable desire for driving transformative social impact.  My experiences in political organizing,
    education reform, research, and consulting have given me a strong foundation in outreach, data analysis,

    bio: `As a person who migrated at the age of 10, I’ve learned the meaning of hard work. I’m a fast
    learner who is always ready for the next challenge and, because of that, I pursue my dreams and
    re-shape them as I continue to grow as a person and a professional. I’m a sociologist and political
    science major, who enjoys interacting with people. I feel comfortable working in a fast-paced
    environment, and thrive in stressful situations. Having been a simultaneous interpreter has made me
    quick, analytical, communicative, fluently bilingual, and has taught me the value of working in a
    multicultural environment. Learn more about my experiences as a member of the

    title: '',
    bio: `I’m always asking questions and digging deep into every issue with an analytical growth mindset.
    My IT support background has enabled me to become a relentless detective, troubleshooting issues until
    real solutions are found. This attitude has also translated into my approach to web development.
    Despite previously having very little knowledge of it, Resilient Coders has taught me that learning
    is really only a matter of time, and persistence; putting in the long hours and having the dedication
    and passion to learn new things, and then using that knowledge to create products, all excites me.
    This has empowered me to be a change agent in my community.`
