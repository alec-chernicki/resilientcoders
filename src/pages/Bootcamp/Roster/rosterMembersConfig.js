    bio: `Migrating from Colombia to the United States as a young boy
      has given me a unique drive and ambition. I’ve been told I
      can’t by many, but that has never stopped me from
      persevering and getting to where I am today. I am a leader,
      aspiring full-stack developer, and an optimist. With a positive
      mind and diligent work ethic, I’m detail-oriented and
      meticulous about completing everyday tasks with excellence.
      I’m a natural leader who welcomes group projects where I
      can effectively communicate with others and aggressively
      drive to accomplish our objectives. Learning is pleasure and
      as full-stack developer in training, I am always reading,
      researching and practicing new techniques to better hone my
      craft. You can see my portfolio at https://arangodavid.github.io/Portfolio/`

    bio: `As far as I am aware I am the first in my family to have any kind of foot in web development, let alone an
affinity for it. Be it for the sake of learning or to make something pleasing to the eye, or to make
something that really engages users and makes it easy and intuitive to navigate, I am almost always
coding. If not coding I enjoy using Photoshop to manipulate and edit images to better fit with said code.
No matter how, even when idle, I am always observing and learning and thinking of how to improve
something. This is thanks to my affinity for web development, for drawing, and for writing. You can see some of my work at https://corriger.github.io/pro-play`

    science major, who enjoys interacting with people. I feel comfortable working in a fast-paced

    My IT support background has enabled me to become a relentless detective, troubleshooting issues until
    real solutions are found. This attitude has also translated into my approach to web development.
    Despite previously having very little knowledge of it, Resilient Coders has taught me that learning
    is really only a matter of time, and persistence; putting in the long hours and having the dedication
    and passion to learn new things, and then using that knowledge to create products, all excites me.
    This has empowered me to be a change agent in my community. My portfolio site is at https://arnoldpires.github.io/Arnold-portfolio/

Problem solving comes naturally to an American soldier, as well as not giving up
until the job is complete. I have a strong background in community
organization, customer service, and IT support. After being the spearhead of a
youth organization, an assistant manager at FedEx and then a soldier, I decided
to take on the challenge of using my design skills to start a career
in front end web development, instead of looking for another
"job". When you hire me, you get someone who is dedicated to work, someone
who is a team player, someone who can take on the greatest of challenges,
someone who can solve a multitude of problems, and most importantly, someone you
know will get the job done.`
