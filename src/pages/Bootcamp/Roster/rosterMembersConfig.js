ethic to do my everyday tasks. As a leader, I get involved in
group projects where I can effectively communicate with
others to get the objective completed. Learning is pleasure

affinity for it. Be it for the sake of learning or to make something pleasing to the eye, or to make
something that really engages users and makes it easy and intuitive to navigate, I am almost always
coding. If not coding I enjoy using Photoshop to manipulate and edit images to better fit with said code.
No matter how, even when idle, I am always observing and learning and thinking of how to improve
something. This is thanks to my affinity for web development, for drawing, and for writing.`

    is really only a matter of time, and persistence; putting in the long hours and having the dedication
    and passion to learn new things, and then using that knowledge to create products, all excites me.
