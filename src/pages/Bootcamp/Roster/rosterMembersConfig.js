Whether competing with my siblings for the highest Space Cadet Pinball score or completing quests in Pokémon, you could always find me near a computer. I later spent time learning to code and customizing personal websites. At the core, problem solving and creativity fueled my desire to learn as much as I could, and to collaborate with my peers. This passion led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and to also look for new ways to share what I had learned with my community. As a software engineer, I enjoy utilizing my creativity and imagination to promote access and empowerment through technology. I hope to bring my engineering skills and passion for problem solving to your team.`

And when I’d learned that, I wanted to kick it up a notch: Rather than tinker with hardcore, why not create with software? Coding has been really interesting to me, because even more exciting than building is the process throwing a wrench in the gears, and then rebuilding. Being challenged is an amazing feeling.

My father who was also an engineer is my inspiration and whom I would like to thank for my early interests in the field of computer programming. As a young professional I have always had a strong work ethic but my true skill lies in being able to assess my work environment and strengthen any weaknesses I see. While at Resilient Coders I was also working full time as a bartender. As I was learning more and more, I found myself anxious to solve the complaints of my customers. This led me to creating my final project: an app that improves the communication between both guests, hosts, and managers to better serve clientele which can be used for both night clubs and restaurants. What I love most about software development is that creativity knows no limit. I look forward to working with organizations that will allow me to assist for the best possible customer journey and user experience.`

However I feel much more than that, I want to show not only my kids but youth everywhere that it doesn't matter where you come from. It's never too not late to not only educate yourself but to pursue a new passion. The tech field is ever expanding and thus makes it a great place to start a career. Something about coding reminds me of Merlin when he first discovered magic. He spent days and even nights on perfecting his craft.

My escapes were either going to a friend’s house or playing at the setup consoles in stores like Wal-Mart or Toys'R'Us. When I finally got my first game, it was not long until I had become completely engulfed in the fantasy world that I had aspired to make my reality. I fell in love with all of the endless possibilities of stories, characters, and worlds. I earned my English Degree (Creative Writing concentration) from Springfield College because of my interest in storytelling and the creation of content in general. As a Resilient Coder, I aimed to learn the tools and basic properties of game-making through code, as well as all of the innovative approaches and critical thinking that comes along with it.

    learning experience at AdCamp NY. Both of these experiences in their own way inspired me to 
    pursue a career in business in college where I l was introduced about the rapid growing tech 
    economy. Now at Resilient Coders, I’m given the opportunity to merge both Business and Tech 
    as a gateway to influence others in my community to move towards an equitable future.

    bio: `I was born in a small Mixtec village in Oaxaca, Mexico. I immigrated to the U.S. at the age of four,
    to reunite with my parents. I majored in Marketing, and applied my skills to promote my family’s restaurant,
    La Morada, executing digital marketing campaigns. This involved social media, email, and creating their website.
    La Morada is now an acclaimed Mexican restaurant in New York City and has appeared in the New York Times, Bloomberg
    Magazine, and the Wall Street Journal. My experience with digital marketing gave me a taste for web development.
    I wanted to empower myself further so I became involved with Resilient Coders. Resilient has trained me to become
    a full-stack engineer fluent in Javascript, CSS, Node, and Ruby, which I used to build a delivery app for La Morada.
    I am looking forward to use my development skills to further empower my community by working in a social enterprise
    sector of the tech industry.`

    bio: `I'm an imaginative, strategic thinker, an “architect,” but I am truly only a “pizzaiolo.”
    I have a talent for fixing and building things, both online and with my hands, and I am passionate
    about my education. I moved to Boston from Washington D.C. in 2013 pursuing a career in the pizza
    industry. After not having resources or access to startup capital, I ultimately decided to put my
    pizza dreams on hold to pursue my inclination to obtain a marketable skill in the tech industry.
    Learning how to code seemed to be the most intuitive route to take.  At Resilient Coders, I have
    spent the past three months learning  HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, Node, React, and Mongo DB,
    building projects like websites and applications. I am pursuing an opportunity to be a part of a
    development team that creates amazing products that resolve issues that align with my interests, values, and morals.`

    bio: `I have been interacting and exploring the internet since I was first introduced to dial-up service.
    Now as an adult I have delved into web development in the hopes of creating tech that can better serve the
    community, raise the quality of living for all, and allow us all to thrive in the ever-changing tech industry.
    So far I've learned HTML, CSS, JS, Mongo DB, React, and Node. I have built CRUD applications, and explored APIs.

I intend to integrate my web development skills to help better serve the film, media, and music industries. I'm
working towards establishing a career creating applications and/or websites with unique user interface design,
and features built to support artists and creatives. Joining Resilient Coders has given me the opportunity to
learn the skills necessary to build the tech that can shape many lives, including my own.`

    bio: `Since I was about 5 years old, I have always aspired to be a video game designer. I've had an interest
    in how video games work beyond the relationship of the player with their controller. I used to spend countless
    hours playing video games and finding glitches; it was always interesting to see when they happened. As I
    continued to grow, I worked on broadening my versatility. Using the tools I had at my disposal, I taught
    myself how to be a visual artist, a musician, and more importantly, a reliable technologist. Around my
    teenage years I had a plethora of traumatic experiences, including the loss of both of my parents, and
    becoming a foster child. With that in mind, I had to use the skills I'd obtained to create something out
    of nothing and continue doing what I do best: acquiring knowledge. I hope to extend my repertoire with the
    help of Resilient Coders and open more doors for a long-term career, whether it is continuing to become a
    video game designer, software engineer, or full stack web developer.`

    bio: `From a young age I have always had knack for technology. Whenever my parents bought a new phone or computer,
    I was tasked with learning how to use it and teaching everyone in the house. In high school, I took apart a few
    computers that weren’t working and put them back together for fun. My name is Kordel Latimer and I am a web developer.
    I graduated from Elms College with a Bachelor's in Computers Information Technology (CIT). I have worked with clients
    at my internship to create websites, logos or business cards, and maintained and updated the computers in the lab.
    I've since returned to Boston to help out my family. I am truly grateful for the opportunity with Resilient Coders.
    Not only because I got to achieve my dream of becoming a full-stack web developer, but because I have learned valuable
    life skills that overall have made me a better person, and more resilient in the pursuit of any goal I have in front of me.`
