    I started off as a mechanic at a young age, having a natural talent for diagnosing and
    fixing problems. After 7 years in the field I felt like there were greater opportunities where I could
    apply my problem solving and diagnostic abilities. After a lot of research and practice
    I fell in love with web development and programming, where I have honed my skillset. I am a hard

    With my new skills in html, css and javascript, I want to start building websites for companies
    that try to make a positive change in this world. I am also looking to create a website myself
    that I hope can make a change, specifically in low-income communities. One of my goals is to
    soon build a website for people in low-income communities that suffer from mental illness.
    Mental Illness is something that usually goes ignored, or untreated in these communities mainly
    because it is not covered by insurance and treatment can sometimes be expensive. Because of this,
    I want to create a website that provides these services for free so there soon can be a  decrease
    in the amount of untreated mental disorders in low income communities. Since I am going back to
    school soon I will not be able to work full time, but am still open for clients to do freelance work for.`

    gives me the ability to build and produce creative ideas; and I love that sense of calmness.
    Turning imagination into reality is very much an everyday possibility and I enjoy my
    transformation into a tech wizard. I am a quick learner. And with the training I'm getting
    at Resilient Coders, I am developing my talent more and more. I aspire to be a full stack
    developer, and my dedication will guide me to get there. I am very grateful for the
    fundamentals Resilient Coders has taught me but most of all I think of my chance to expound

    Like many other inner city youth, I haven’t had the easiest life. But when life throws you lemons
    you have to make lemonade, right? I have been blessed with a great support system of friends that
    have always pushed me to do better. My proudest of accomplishments that have been borne from my
    resiliency was a Google internship I managed to acquire. From that internship I learned about
    the most practical methods for troubleshooting computers of all kinds. It showed me what the
    technology field truly has to offer through the traveling and connections I made. Developers
    would be frequent clients of mine during my internship and hearing about their work would always
    be a highlight of my day. It completely changed my life’s perspective on what is possible when
    you put your all into your actions. It also opened my eyes on what my career path could become.
    I had always been interested in coding and Resilient Coders gave me the perfect vehicle to begin

    professional that grew up in Dorchester, MA and graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Business

    I was doing grassroots marketing with Sony Music and Cornerstone Agency and other
    brand ambassadors positions, but I was more passionate about my personal blog on
    culture and lifestyle. Add - I always wanted to learn coding since the days of Tumblr.
    I enjoyed designing my blog, and became interested in learning more about how to code.

    I first attended General Assembly to become a Front-End Web Developer. I became
    entranced by the possibilities of manipulating the DOM and creating webpages simply with
    HTML5 and CSS3. Then, Resilient Coders helped me enhance my skills. I have found my niche
    with designing and creating an alternate universe, in which a website can be customized
    and built from scratch through wireframes, sheer imagination and knowledge.

    I enjoy bringing my unique mindset to the field, and eventually want to help other women
    of color enter this industry too. To diversify the field through education and paying
    it forward would make me feel accomplished in more ways than one. I am elated to accept

    It’s amazing what you can learn with a little ambition, hustle and drive. Before this bootcamp,
    I saw coding as a career path unattainable without a college degree. The fact that we have crammed
    4 years of college into 8 weeks of studies keeps me in awe. With a creative background in print,
    design and installation, I have always understood how to take a client's concept and create a design
    based on developing more customer traffic and revenue. I will now be able to take the same principles
    I have learned out in the entrepreneurial world and utilize them in my future on the web. I hope to
    one day take my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and become a full-stack developer.
    My leadership and communication skills helped me start my own business and have taught me that
    you will learn more from your downfalls than from your glory.  As one of my favorite quotes puts it,
    “You miss 100 percent of the shots you don’t take.” This is one shot I will not miss.`
