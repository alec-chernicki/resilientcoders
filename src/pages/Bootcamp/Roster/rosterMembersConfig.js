    coveted Ranger tab. It taught me to be a leader by example. Combat missions enabled me
    to be a problem solver as a sergeant deployed with 82nd Airborne. After the military,
    I attended Howard University. During college I started several businesses while still
    being a student leader and maintaining my GPA. College enabled me to be an organizer
    and time manager. I was the lead campus ambassador for a startup that was acquired,
    BAE: Before Anyone Else. That acquisition inspired me to build a personal project,
    FRWD, that helps Americans automate their savings through a web/mobile application.
    I’m currently working on the front end with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript and for my
    mobile application React. My name is Anthony Moore, I have an entrepreneurial mindset,

    the streets of Florida, I was crazy about ones and zeros. You can make nothing into something, on anything with a
    screen. I didn’t start chasing this curiosity until I moved to Boston and got into a bad skateboarding accident.
    Not being able to skateboard until my body was healed made me depressed so I put my energy towards school. My
    history teacher realized that I’m a stickler for numbers. After conducting some research, he found a program called
    Resilient Coders. He made an appointment for us to meet with Del, its Founder and Executive Director.
    In our early days together, before RC was even running a Bootcamp program, I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even explored Rails.
    I was hired as a web development intern at The Grommet. I have since returned to Resilient Coders, to hone my skills,

Being the youngest of 4, it’s not a promise your voice will be heard or respected, so when I told my parents I was going to transition to web-development I knew I had to prove I was serious.
Through my journey at Resilient Coders I developed good habits such as “Sacrificing Time,” “Embracing the unknown”, and consistency. It was tough sometimes but help was there. The love and support I received on the daily helped me shape a “no excuse” type of attitude for myself, which I know will translate well in my job search. I am happy to announce, I HAVE TRUSTED THE PROCESS!. Resilient Coders has guided me to be able to create and understand websites and apps using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, ES6, and React in only 3 months. And with that being said, It’s a blessing to be apart of an opportunity so rare, and hopefully my own self-advocacy will be an asset to your team.
