She landed a job as a Frontend Web Developer at Everquote in Cambridge. With these new-found skills, she devotes time to personal development and mentoring new coders, even if remotely, on a daily basis. Dunia is a born and raised Bostonian, and now that The Tech Hub has migrated here, she would love to see a range of diversity showcased in the field. And as a Resilient Coders alumna, it is now part of her mission to help make that happen. When she’s not writing code, you can find her whipping up a yummy treat, reading a book imprinted with baby drool or taking a much-needed nap.`
